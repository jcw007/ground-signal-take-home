## Ground Signal Take-home Coding Assignment

### Technologies Utilized

#### Frontend

- **React**: Implemented with a data store and custom hooks to encapsulate data-related logic. The application comprises:
  - A map component powered by react-map-gl
  - A search input component for text-based queries
  - A drawer component housing the add new location/place form and existing locations list
  - A modal popup displaying selected location details
  - A clickable tab for exporting starred location data
- **react-map-gl**: Chosen over Google Maps due to API key recognition issues
- **Recharts**: Utilized for rendering average store traffic bar charts
- **Zustand**: Employed for global state management, storing place data from JSON file for cross-component access
- **React Icons**: Provides a comprehensive icon collection for React
- **TailwindCSS**: Facilitates component styling without separate CSS files

#### Backend

- **json-server**: Sufficient for this assignment, though a more robust solution like Express.js or Apollo/GraphQL would be preferable in a production environment

### Requirement Implementation Notes

1. **Autocomplete Search Field**: Implements a 300ms debounce to optimize API calls during user input.
2. **Locations/Markers**: Persist on the map until a new search is executed.
3. **Location Starring**: Retrieves starred locations from the API by checking the "starred" property in each location object. Note: Initial implementation revealed inconsistencies in json-server's handling of boolean values and object IDs.
4. **CRUD/Data Synchronization**: Generally effective between Zustand store and json-server, with some areas requiring further investigation for real-time updates.
5. **User Interface**: Further refinement opportunities exist, particularly for the Place list in the right drawer.
6. **Unit Testing**: If time permits, I would implement unit tests to ensure the reliability of critical components and functions. This would involve writing tests that validate the expected behavior of the applicationâ€™s features, such as the search functionality and data synchronization processes. Utilizing frameworks like Jest or Mocha would facilitate automated testing, helping to catch bugs early and improve overall code quality.

## Application Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Launch the frontend application:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Start json-server:
   ```
   npx json-server --watch data/db.json
   ```
